Project Idea:


A simple Card Matching game. 

User will be able to match a minimum of 6 pairs of cards,
the programe will first show the cards briefly before fliping them over. 
The user will then be able to flip the cards two at a time, if the match is correct the cards will stay
right side up, if not they will flip back over so the user can continue playing. 
Once all pairs have been made the game will end and the user will have the option to play again.
